Hello World!
Really hoping I can be disciplined to learn much on TOP.
Insert more text.
I spent much time trying Linux than actually studying TOP.
First attempt was on a Virtual Machine, which hogs all of my resources.
Second was dual-booting different Linux distros on secondary SSD. mainly Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Fedora and Pop!OS
Third was just coming back to Windows again and just use WSL2.
I hope I can really progress now this time LOL
This file name should be hello_diary instead of hello_world
